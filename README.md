# Unemployment and the Informal Economy  
### A Comparative Analysis among Least Developed, Developing, and Developed Countries (1993‚Äì2020)

This repository contains the final project for my graduate course **ECO530: Econometrics** at the University of Maine. The study investigates how the relationship between **unemployment rates** and the **informal economy** varies across countries at different stages of development: **least developed**, **developing**, and **developed** nations.

## üß≠ Project Objective

The main objective of this study is to explore the impact of the informal economy on unemployment across varying economic development contexts. The analysis uses panel data from 148 countries covering the period **1993‚Äì2020**, and examines whether the informal sector acts as a labor absorber or contributor to labor market inefficiencies.

## üìä Methodology & Tools

### Econometric Models:
- **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**
- **Fixed Effects Panel Regression**  
  (with country-specific and year-specific effects)

### Informal Economy Estimations:
- **MIMIC (Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes)**  
  A structural equation modeling framework capturing latent informality.
- **DGE (Dynamic General Equilibrium)**  
  A macroeconomic model simulating labor allocation over time.

### Tools Used:
- **R** (for data processing and modeling)
- **MS Excel** (data compilation and cleaning)
- **PowerPoint/PDF** (poster and visual presentation)

## üîç Key Findings

- **Least Developed Countries:**  
  Weak or insignificant effect of informality on unemployment‚Äîlikely due to underdeveloped labor markets and low productivity.

- **Developing Countries:**  
  Mixed results: Informal economy may reduce unemployment by absorbing excess labor, but may also hinder the growth of formal sectors.

- **Developed Countries:**  
  Strong positive correlation between informality and unemployment, suggesting that informal sectors disrupt formal labor markets.

- The divergence between **MIMIC** and **DGE** model results emphasizes the importance of methodological choice in evaluating informal economies.
